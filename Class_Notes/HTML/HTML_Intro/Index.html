        <!-- Create a new file in this directory called 'blog.html'. 
            This will be an HTML Blog with 3 posts on Summer Activities.
        
            Each post should have a title, an image, a brief description of the activity and a list.
        
            For example, you can do one post on summer cooking recupes, another on places to hike, 
            and a post on fun travel destinations. Be creative and a personal touch to it.

            When complete, please commit your new html blog file and push to GitHub online. 
            
            Please share your GitHub pages link to me via Teams.
